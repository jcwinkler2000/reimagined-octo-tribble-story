Once upon a time there was an old man named Bill. Bill lived in Shady Oaks retirement center. Bill didn't
like living there, however he tolerated it because he got ulimited pudding for snacks. One day Bill was
screaming at one of the caretakers to fetch him pudding as usual. But this time instead of getting pudding,
he got applesauce instead! Apparently they had replaced all the pudding with applesauce. Bill was furious
applesauce was his least favorite food. This was the last straw, he had had enough of being stuck here.
