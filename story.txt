Once upon a time there was an old man named Bill. Bill lived in Shady Oaks retirement center. Bill didn't
like living there, however he tolerated it because he got ulimited pudding for snacks. One day Bill was
screaming at one of the caretakers to fetch him pudding as usual. But this time instead of getting pudding,
he got applesauce instead! Apparently they had replaced all the pudding with applesauce. Bill was furious
applesauce was his least favorite food. This was the last straw, he had had enough of being stuck here.
	He was going to leave, but before he did so he decided to teach those lousy caretakers a lesson.
He secretly ordered 95lbs of pudding from Costco using his hidden offshore account he never told anyone
he had. Bill ordered it to his buddy Bob's house after telling him about his plan. Bob had agreed to work
in cahoots with Bill because he had never liked those people at Shady Oaks either. The workers were far too
healthy for either of them.
	That night, Bill and Bob broke into Shady Oaks and emptied all the cups of apple sauce out of the fridge. They then replaced them with the cups of pudding they bought from Costco.
	The next day rolled around, and now it was time to see if there were consequences for their shenanigans. Bill went to go get breakfast as he usually does. As he was eating, he could see a small group of employees congregated nearby, talking rather quietly and occasionally glancing in Bill's direction. Eventually, one employee broke from the group and approached Bill with a solemn expression. "What do you want this time?" Bill asked. "Shady Oaks was broken into last night Bill, do you happen to know anything about that?" the employee asked.
